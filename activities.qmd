### Braincraft (2026…)

Brain research has made tremendous progress over the last few decades
in nearly all areas of investigation and yet, the comprehension of
cognition still eludes us because most high-level functions, such as
decision making, results from the complex and dynamic interaction
between several structures. On the one hand we have a fragmented
collection of computational models whose unification is out of reach,
on the other hand we have holistic approaches whose complexity
obliterates any hope of comprehension. Our project proposes to build
the foundations of a research program in neuroscience in order to
explain how cognition developed in most vertebrates, supported by an
epistemological framework for taming the inherent complexity and a
transcription into operational models of the evolutionary,
developmental and ecological constraints. Informed by neuroscience and
guided by philosophy, we propose to define and build a series of
computational, embodied and intelligible models along the phylogenetic
and ontogenetic axes, with the parallel study of their biological
counterparts.

## REWIRE (Horizon Widera)

**(2026-2029)** REWIRE rolls out a practical computational
reproducibility toolkit comprising Reproducibility Management Plans
(RMPs) implemented in ARGOS, RO-Crates to describe machine actionable
DMPs, and package data/code/workflows with metadata and provenance for
comparison, sharing, publishing, the use of GNU Guix for coding in
reproducible environments linked to Software Heritage via for
archiving SWHID (Software Hash Identifier) to ensure long term
archiving, and capacity building & communities (role-specific
training, Train-the-Trainer, clinics and an on-ramp prioritising
widening countries). Objectives are phased to: (1) set up and start
deployments, (2) widen adoption, (3) synthesise evidence for policy,
and (4) secure stewardship and continuity. Detailed validation
approaches are provided in the Methodology; below we state only what
will be produced and how progress will be evidenced at a high level.

**Ecomob (Regional grant 2019-2022)** A joint project between University of La
Rochelle, University of Bordeaux and Inria for the study of eco-mobility and
the modelling of multi-criteria decision.

<!--
**SOMA (ANR/FNSNF 2018-2021)** This project is a unique collaboration between neuro-hardware, cellular computing, reconfigurable computing and neuroscience that aims at defining a new computational paradigm: a self-organizing and adaptive architecture with the design of an experimental hardware chip.

### Surveillance (2024…)

At the crossroads of various scientific disciplines, such as law,
computer science, information and communication sciences, sociology,
history, economics, and political science, the [Observatoire de la
surveillance en démocratie (Observatory on Surveillance in Democracy,
OSD)](https://observatoire-surveillance-democratie.fr/) aims to
promote multidisciplinary research and expertise on surveillance
phenomena in democracy. In particular, the OSD aims to take stock of
the techniques used by private and public actors whose goal—or
effect—is to monitor part or all of the population.  Following my many
interventions about AI, I've decided to join the observatory from the
start in order to study the the impact of latest AI techniques on
democracy. This requires a true multi-disciplinary approach because
the problem is complex and requires expertise from several
disciplines, including computer science.


### Reproducibility (2015…)

The [French Reproducible Research
Network](https://www.recherche-reproductible.fr/) is a national
initiative bringing together scientists engaged in the study of
factors promoting reproducibility in research. Although the challenges
of reproducibility vary across disciplines, they concern all
scientific fields. The network therefore strives to represent a rich
and balanced disciplinary diversity. The network has approximately 350
members registered, holding a variety of positions and come from
numerous institutions throughout France. At least 30 different
disciplines are represented. This diversity is a fundamental element
of the network, which aims to promote the exchange of best practices
and stimulate discussion around common procedures in different
disciplines.

I've co-funded the network in 2020 with Sarah Cohen-Boulakia, Frédéric
Lemoire and Arnaud Legrand, following my interest in reproducibility
for more than a decade. We organized the first conference in 2022 at
Institut Pasteur and the network has grown to more than 400 members.
We are about to join the [global
federation](https://reproducibility.global/) that we helped to shape.

**[Hyperhum@in]((https://www.mshbx.fr/en/brain-machine-model-analogy-identity-neuroscience-and-artificial-intelligence-in-hyperhuman-mirror/)) (Inria / Université Bordeaux-Montaigne 2023-2024)** The Hyperhum@in research program brings together a core group of researchers in HSS and life sciences committed to questioning exploratory engineering projects “at the frontiers of the human”.  The second part, entitled “brain-machine: analogy, model, identity”, proposes to take a combined look at Artificial Intelligence and cognitive neuroscience which have today become inseparable in their mutual quest for intelligibility of the functioning of the human brain.

### Hypermondes (2020…)

[Hypermondes](http://hypermondes.fr) is an annual cultural event based
in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of France, specifically dedicated to
Science and Fiction (including science fiction, fantasy, and the
fantastic). The festival was co-founded by Natacha Vas-Deyres, a
teacher and researcher specializing in science fiction and speculative
fiction, Fabrice Carré, computer scientist and president of SO Games,
astrophysicist Franck Selsis, publisher André-François Ruaud, and a
collective of authors, booksellers, communication professionals, and
researchers.

The festival is held every third week of September in the city of
Mérignac. What distinguishes Hypermondes from traditional literary
fairs is its commitment to an interdisciplinary approach. The festival
serves as a bridge between creative arts and rigorous scientific
inquiry, inviting a diverse range of participants that includes
authors, illustrators, filmmakers, and research scientists. By
fostering a dialogue between sciences and speculative fiction, the
event seeks to explore how imagined futures can be grounded in
contemporary scientific reality.

I've been serving as vice-president of the association since 2021 and
help organizing the festival as well as the life of the association.

### Psyphine (2010…)

[Psyphine](https://psyphine.hypotheses.org/) is a multidisciplinary
lab (computer science, philosophy, psychology, neuroscience,
linguistic, ethnology) funded in 2010 that studies cognition from a
theoretical and experimental perspective, centered around our
relationship with manufactured objects. This relationship has been
disrupted in recent years by the emergence of objects in our homes
that are capable of acting and perceiving, such as autonomous vacuum
cleaners, artificial companions and artificial assistants. While these
objects offer varying degrees of complexity, their main characteristic
is their ability to interact with the environment and people. However,
understanding and analyzing these interactions requires the
interweaving of numerous hypotheses, conditions, and parameters that
are ultimately very difficult to assess within a single scientific
discipline. Anthropology, philosophy, psychology, neuroscience,
robotics, computer science, sociolinguistics, art, design: all these
disciplines, whether scientific or not, have something to contribute
to the subject and to teach other disciplines.

To study these issues, the Psyphine group brings together researchers
from various disciplines (anthropology, computer science,
neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, sociolinguistics) from different
laboratories at the University of Lorraine (ATILF, Interpsy, LORIA,
AHP-Prest), the Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases in Bordeaux,
the Jean Nicod Institute in Paris, and the EHESS Social Anthropology
Laboratory. In the meantime, we're also trying to gather a community
around these questions and so far, we've organised [3 conferences, 6
workshops, one Summer school and one hackathon](https://psyphine.hypotheses.org/rencontrer-psyphine).
